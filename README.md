PrivacyButton
=============

Periodically reset your browser to sane defaults with a webextension. This
plugin is **barely started** in fact it's basically **exploratory** at this
point. If it's impossible to accomplish the task with a WebExtension then
other approaches should be evaluated.

Features
--------

Adds a button and presents a menu to:

  * [partial] **Set** fingerprint-focused defaults on start
  * [] **Warn** on specific risky changes to settings
  * [partial] **Reset** fingerprint-focused defaults on user-issued command
  * [] **Integrate** with the contextual-identities API
